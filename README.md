# Graphing Calculator for 3DS

I guess you could say this is the exact opposite of games that run on graphing calculators.

Requires [sf2dlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sf2dlib) and [sftdlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sftdlib).

## Controls

* **Circle pad:** Pan view, move cursor
* **L / R:** Zoom
* **Up / Down:** Change active plot (for equation editing/trace cursor)
* **X:** Hold for free cursor
* **Y:** Hold to trace graph (hold **B** to snap to units)
* **Select (![deIlluminati](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/46248/1.0)):** Reset view
* **Start:** Quit

## Important notes

* Equations must be entered in RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). This means, for example, rather than "sin(4 + x)", you would enter "4 x + sin".
* If you've entered a number and want to start entering a new number immediately after, press the decimal point key twice, or only once if there's already a decimal point.
* Yes, I know about the issue where the text sometimes shifts to the left a little. I think that's a bug in sftdlib.
